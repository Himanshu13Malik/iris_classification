# Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

This is my first machine learning project!  
I used the famous **Iris dataset** and tried out different algorithms to classify flowers into 3 types:  
- Setosa  
- Versicolor  
- Virginica  

---

## What I did
- Loaded the Iris dataset using `scikit-learn`
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Trained different models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, etc.)
- Checked accuracy of each model
- Plotted confusion matrices and heatmaps to see results clearly

---

## Results
- Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest gave high accuracy  
- KNN accuracy changed a lot depending on train/test split  
- Confusion matrix heatmaps show how many flowers were classified correctly or misclassified

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo  
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
